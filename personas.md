# Nick, a high school student

Nick, age 16, is a high school student at Midwood High School. He has a group of 5 friends including him that he hangs out with every day in school. They had been friends since middle school and had always been together in school. 

Nick plays games but only single-player games at home. He doesn't like the multiplayer games out there because it's either too competitive or it doesn't allow a group of 5. He wants a game that allows the 5 of them to play together outside of school at home that's not too competitive.
